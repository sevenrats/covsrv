# Limitations
## Only supports one repo per instance
Need to refactor this heavily and extend the schema and api structure to support multiple repos

# Roadmap
## Support multiple repos
## Support key creation and registration
This also needs to be designed. I want it to be usable but as simple as possible.

## Refactor and clean up
This is just one big blob of vibe code that still needs to be cleaned up and separated by concern

## Unit Coverage
Unit tests need to be implemented once the code is refactored
